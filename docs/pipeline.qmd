### Quality control 




### Clonotype assembly with [MIXCR](https://mixcr.com)

**MIXCR** is one of the state-of-the-art methods to assemble repertoire data. SatTCR utilizes MIXCR to assemble the user sequencing files, and aggregated bootstrap samples of any / all the sequencing files.

### Saturation analysis 

SatTCR utilizes a sequential bootstrap approach to sample aggreagated datasets such that one with lower sequencing depth ($\mathcal{S}_1$) is contained in one with higher sequencing depth: $\mathcal{S}_1\subset \mathcal{S}_2$; and that way is possible to look at the trends at which clonotypes are assembled when more reads are included in a TCR experiment.
