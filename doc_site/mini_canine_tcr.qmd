title: "Analysis of Canine TCR data from Zuleger et al 2024 (only two small samples)" 
from: markdown+emoji
---

This material is the same as in [the Canine TCR analysis](canine_tcr.qmd), the only difference is that we are only using the two samples available in the repository.

For this example, we assume that SatTCR is already downloaded, `snakemake` and `docker` are already installed in the system, and that the `docker` images are already pulled, i.e. we assume that the first steps of the [Getting started](getting_started.qmd) page are already done.

We also assume that we are located in the `SatTCR` directory after cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Ong-Research/SatTCR
cd SatTCR

```

## Additional files to download

1. MIXCR's license: This can be downloaded from their website: <https://mixcr.com/mixcr/getting-started/milm/>. We rename the file as `license_mixcr`, and the name is coded in the `mixcr/license_file` field in the config file.
2. IMGT reference file: This can be downloaded from the `repseqio` repository release: <https://github.com/repseqio/library-imgt/releases>. In the screenshot below, we can see that the IMGT file could be `imgt.202214-2.sv8.json` after decompressing it.

```{r}
#| label: "repseqio-page"
#| include: true
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-cap: "Screenshot of the repseqio repository release page"

knitr::include_graphics("assets/repseqio_page.png")

```

## Making the `samples.csv` file

The name of this file is coded in the config file `samplefile` entry. For the moment, we assume that the sequencing files are located in the `data` folder. For example, in this repository, we have the following files:

```bash
ls data

K9013v01-rxn1_S425_L003
K9013v01-rxn2_S426_L003

```

These are two paired RNA-seq files corresponding to two samples; so the `samples.csv` looks as:

```csv
sample_name,sample_file
sample1,data/K9013v01-rxn1_S425_L003
sample2,data/K9013v01-rxn2_S426_L003
```

The first column is the name that is going to be used for the respective samples, and the second one is the name of the file until the "_R1" / "_R2" parts. The remaining part of the file names is defined in the `suffix` entry of the configuration file. In the case of these two files, that is `_001.fastq.gz`. 

## Running the pipeline

### Quality control

The quality control module of the pipeline does the following:

1. Runs `fastqc` for every sequencing file, and gather all the results in a `multiqc` report.

2. Uses `dada2`'s to plot quality profiles.

The underlying assumption for this step is the that `docker images` for the `fastqc`, `multiqc` and `rquarto` have been installed already. After this steps are completed, then run with 4 cores:

```bash
snakemake -c4 qc
```

Using the rule:

```bash
snakemake -c4 qc_report
```

will generate the QC page of the complete report. Alternatively, the quality profiles are saved in the `figs` directory, and one of them looks like:

```{r}
#| label: "fig-example-qc-profile"
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"
#| fig-cap: "Quallity profile for the tech1 files"

knitr::include_graphics("cases/mini_canine_tcr/figs/sample1_qc_profile.png")

```

Each panel in the plot correspond to one of the sequence files for the sample:

1. The x-axis corresponds to the nucleotides in the sequences, labeled as `Cycles`, and the y-axis correspond to the quality score for each nucleotide in each sequence.

2. In the background of each panel, there is a heatmap indicating the % of nucleotides at the $i$-th position among all sequences with a given quality score. The black bars at the top means that the majority of the nucleotides have a high score.

3. The green line is the avg. score at each position, where the orange line are the median (full) and 25% / 75% quantiles (dashed). These lines and the grey shades below 30 indicate that there are few sequences that need to be trimmed.

Generally we could expected:

- The quality scores at the R2 end panel are a bit noisier than the ones in the R1 end panel.

- The quality scores at the end of the sequences tend to be equal or lower than the ones a the start of the sequences.



### Trim sequences

This step assumes that the docker's `trimmomatic` image has been already installed. Then, following the previous section, we know now that we need to trim the sequences. The tail at the end of the R2 panel indicates that there are a few sequences with QC score < 20, so we remove the parts after that QC score is reached with the `TRAILING:20` option. There could be some remaining small fragments, and we remove the short fragments with length of 100 of less with the `MINLEN:100` option. 

```yaml
trim:
  trimmer: ["TRAILING:20", "MINLEN:100"]
```

More documentation on trimmomatic's options are in [their website](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic). We run this module with:


```bash
snakemake -c4 trim
```

### Clonotype assembly

The main line to pay attention in the config file is the `mixcr/params` line. We used:

```yaml
rna-seq --species dog -b imgt.202214-2 --rna
```

which means that our primers look line the `rna-seq` configuration from the MIXCR's list of pre-set configurations. The species is `dog`, and the TCRB V and J gene sequences are obtained from the `imgt.202214-2` file (that we already downloaded and decompressed). MIXCR is very flexible, and [provides an extensive list of pre-set options](https://mixcr.com/mixcr/reference/overview-mixins-list/).

The clonotypes are assembled using the command:

```bash
snakemake -c4 mixcr
```

Using the rule:

```bash
snakemake -c4 repertoire_report
```

will generate the report until section, i.e. everything except the saturation analysis.

### Sampling of the sequencing files and saturation analysis

There are two fields that are important for this section:

```yaml
seed: [54232, 65432]
```

and

```yaml
saturation:
  samples: ["sample1", "sample2"]
  bootstrap_replicates: 10 # 200  
  # only one of block_size or nblocks is supposed to be Null
  block_size: Null
  nblocks: 10
```

This step samples pairs of sequences from the trimmed files corresponding to the `tech1` and `tech2` samples. The way it works is that for each random seed, it splits the paired sequence file into 10 blocks, in this case each block with 10% of the trimmed sequences, and then samples orderings among the 10 blocks. For example, an ordering could be `5, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` and this will result with the 10% sequence file being block `5`, the 20% sequence file being blocks `5` and `4` together and so on.

In general, this steps generated `nblocks` $\times$ `bootstrap_replicates` $\times$ `# of seeds` paired-sequence files for each one of the `samples` that were defined. This means that in our current scenario, we are generating $2 \times 2 \times 10 \times 10 = 400$ pairs of files.

This module is run using:

```bash
snakemake -c4 sampling
```

For this step we suggest to use few seeds, and don't divide the files into too many blocks. Then, to assembly the clonotypes of these files, we run the saturation module using:

```bash
snakemake -c4 saturation
```

### Building the report

If the previous steps worked, then this is run using:

```bash
snakemake -c4 report
```

The details of the  report are coded in the `summary` section of the configuration file:

```yaml
summary:
  min_count: 5    # min. # of times of repeats to consider a clonotype
  vj_quantile: .15    #  
  groups: {
    "group1": ["sample1", "sample2"]}
```

The `groups` part indicate which samples correspond to each group. In this case, the groups correspond to biological replicates, but it may well correspond to conditions or any other characteristics considered in the experiment. The only key in the dictionary 'group1' is the name of the plot.

The complete report is available in [here](cases/mini_canine_tcr/index.html). For the saturation analysis, this will generate figures like @fig-saturation. The linear growth in the figure below indicates that a higher sequencing depth is required to adequately sample the TCR repertoire.


```{r}
#| label: "fig-saturation"
#| fig-cap: "Saturation analysis for canine TCR control samples"
#| echo: false
#| out-width: "80%"

knitr::include_graphics("cases/mini_canine_tcr/saturation_files/figure-html/fig-saturation-nclones-1.png")


```

## Complete configuration file:

The complete `config.yaml` file looks like:

```yaml
{{< include cases/_files/mini_canine_tcr/config.yaml >}}
```
